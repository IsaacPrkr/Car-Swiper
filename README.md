Car Swiper is a social web application inspired by the swipe-left/swipe-right experience of dating apps, but designed for car enthusiasts. Users can create an account, upload photos and details of their own vehicles, and then browse through a gallery of cars uploaded by others. By swiping right to "like" or left to "pass," users can express interest in other cars and connect with fellow enthusiasts who share similar tastes.

The platform aims to foster a vibrant community where users can:

Discover unique and interesting cars from around the world.
Showcase their own vehicles and receive feedback from other car lovers.
Match with users who have mutual interests, opening the door to new friendships, car meets, and collaborations.
Build a personal network of like-minded individuals, potentially leading to real-world connections and events.
